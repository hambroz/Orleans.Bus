How to use
-----------

1. Reference Orleans.IoC.dll and Orleans.Bus.dll from both grain interface and grain implementation projects

2. For assembly, which contains grain interfaces and code generated by Orleans codegen, set description to:

   		[assembly: AssemblyDescription("Contains.Orleans.Generated.Code")]

   WARN: Otherwise Orleans.IoC won't be able to find assemblies wich contain static factory classes.

3. Make sure that you grain interfaces are marked with one of the IGrainWithXXXId interfaces.
   Choose the most appropriate one. Make sure you also implement IGrain iterface.

4. Link Grain.cs and ObservableGrain.cs files, which you can find inside 'linked' folder 
   within Orleans.IoC and Orleans.Bus package directories to your grain implementation project. 
   Inherit you grain from corresponding Grain or ObservableGrain base classes.

5. Make public field in you Grain of type IMessageBus and initialize it to MessageBus.Instance
   Having this, you can easily mock IMessageBus to test actor interactions.

6. In order to have full testability, make sure that from within grain/client code, 
   you're using only services provided by Orleans.IoC and Orleans.Bus.
