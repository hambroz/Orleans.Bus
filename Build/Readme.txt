How to use
-----------

1. Reference Orleans.Bus.dll and Orleans.Bus.Observables.dll from both grain interface and grain implementation projects

2. For assembly, which contains grain interfaces and code generated by Orleans codegen, set description to:

   		[assembly: AssemblyDescription("Contains.Orleans.Generated.Code")]

   WARN: Otherwise Orleans.Bus won't be able to find assemblies wich contain static factory classes.

3. Make sure that you grain interfaces are marked with one of the IHaveXXXId interfaces.
   Choose the most appropriate one. Make sure you also implement IGrain iterface.

4. Link MessageBasedGrain.cs file, which you can find inside 'linked' folder 
   within Orleans.Bus package directory, to your grain implementation project. 
   
5. Inherit you grain from corresponding MessageBasedGrainWithXXXId 
   or ObservableMessageBasedGrainWithXXXId base classes.

6. In order to have full testability, make sure that from within grain/client code, 
   you're using only services provided by Orleans.Bus (IMessageBus and IObservableCollection)
