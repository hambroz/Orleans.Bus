How to use
-----------

1. Reference Orleans.Bus.dll and Orleans.Bus.Observables.dll 
   from both grain interface and grain implementation projects

2. For assembly, which contains grain interfaces and code generated by Orleans, set description to:

   		[assembly: AssemblyDescription("Contains.Orleans.Generated.Code")]

   WARN: Otherwise Orleans.Bus won't be able to find assemblies wich contain static factory classes.

3. Make sure that you grain interfaces are marked with [ExtendedPrimaryKey].
   Handler methods with [Handler] and events are advertised via [Publisher] if any.
   
   * Check sample interfaces in a test project 
     https://github.com/yevhen/Orleans.Bus/tree/master/Source/Bus.Tests.Grains.Interfaces 

4. Link MessageBasedGrain.cs file, which you can find inside 'linked' folder 
   within Orleans.Bus package directory, to your grain implementation project. 
   
5. Inherit you grain from MessageBasedGrain or ObservableMessageBasedGrain base classes.

6. In order to have full testability, make sure that from within grain/client code, 
   you're using only services provided by Orleans.Bus (IMessageBus and IObservableCollection)

7. If you want to unit test you grains in isolation (and why not),
   define GRAIN_STUBBING_ENABLED conditional compilation symbol.   

8. For further details see project documentation on GitHub (https://github.com/yevhen/Orleans.Bus)
